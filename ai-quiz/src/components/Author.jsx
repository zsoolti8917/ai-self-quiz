                I'm a passionate Frontend developer with a strong focus on building innovative web applications. With a background in full-stack development, I enjoy working on projects 
                that solve real-world problems, like this AI-powered quiz app designed to enhance learning and provide personalized feedback.
                <br /><br />
                Throughout my career, I've worked with a variety of technologies, including React, Node.js, and MongoDB, while constantly 
                exploring new ways to integrate AI and machine learning into my projects. In my spare time, I enjoy diving deeper into 
                AI research, contributing to open-source projects, and sharing knowledge with the developer community.
                <br /><br />
                When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the outdoors, learning new programming languages, or tinkering with 
                new technologies. I believe in the transformative power of technology and am always on the lookout for the next big challenge.

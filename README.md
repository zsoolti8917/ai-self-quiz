# AI Quiz App

This is an experimental AI-powered quiz application where users can take quizzes on various topics. The app provides real-time feedback using OpenAI's API for answer evaluation. It allows users to submit their answers, get instant feedback, and even follow up with AI-based discussions for further learning.

This is my first project integrating AI, and it is still in the experimental phase. The project is open-source, and I'm more than happy to accept contributions to help improve it.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

- **Backend** (in the root folder): This is where the server and the logic for interacting with the database and the OpenAI API live.
- **Frontend** (in the `ai-quiz` folder): This contains the React application, which serves the user interface for the quiz application.

## Features

- **Add, update, and manage quiz questions**
- **Real-time feedback on quiz answers using OpenAI**
- **Follow-up conversations with AI to deepen understanding**
- **Progress tracking (planned for future updates)**
- **User authentication (planned for future updates)**

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name `
```
### 2\. Install dependencies

For both the frontend and backend, you'll need to install dependencies. Run the following commands in the project root folder and in the `ai-quiz` folder.

#### Backend (root folder)

```
`npm install`
```
#### Frontend (ai-quiz folder)

```
`cd ai-quiz
npm install`
```
### 3\. Environment Variables

You will need to rename the `.env.model` file to `.env` and add your environmental variables.

-   **MongoDB URL**: Set `DATABASE_URL` to your MongoDB connection string.
-   **OpenAI API Key**: Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your OpenAI API key.

The `.env` file should look like this:


```
`DATABASE_URL=your-mongodb-url
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key`
```
### 4\. Running the Backend

In the root folder, run the backend server:

```
`node server.js`
```
The backend will start and listen for requests on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 5\. Running the Frontend

In the `ai-quiz` folder, you can start the React development server for the frontend:

```
`npm start`
```
The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

Future Improvements
-------------------

This project is currently in an experimental phase, and there are many features planned for future releases, including:

-   **User Authentication**: Allow users to sign up, log in, and save their progress.
-   **Progress Tracking**: Track and display user performance over time, showing quiz history, scores, and areas for improvement.
-   **Personalized Quizzes**: Tailor quizzes based on user performance and preferred topics.
-   **Leaderboard and Competitions**: Add a competitive element with leaderboards.
-   **Mobile App**: Extend the app to mobile platforms for easy access.
